OpenSmalltalk on OpenBSD

OpenSmalltalk appears to be the consolidation
of various modern open-source Smalltalks.

This set of OpenSmalltalk ports can build and install
a variety of images, sources and VMs.


The rest of this document slightly out-of date as of 2017/05/01.


There is also a port for the older Squeak-3.10.

For easy testing, there are currently no port interdependencies.

Remove the (currently unneeded) 'processors/' dir (about 20MB),
re-roll the distfile and 'make makesum' to save time and space.

The Pharo 6.0 and Squeak 6.0alpha images are moving targets.

For easy testing, install sources and images to taste.
VMs can be run from the build dir:

$ /usr/ports/pobj/squeak_cog_spur-5.1/build-i386/squeak /usr/local/share/opensmalltalk/Squeak5.1-16549-32bit.image
