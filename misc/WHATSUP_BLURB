I've collected about as much useful Smalltalk bits and pieces as I could find.

There may be more to add but now the focus is on the details of building.


Notes:

For easy testing, there are currently no port interdependencies.

Remove the (currently unneeded) 'processors/' dir (about 20MB),
re-roll the distfile and 'make makesum' to save time and space.

For easy testing, install sources and images to taste.
VMs can be run from the build dir:

$ /usr/ports/pobj/squeak_cog_spur-5.1/build-i386/squeak \
    /usr/local/share/opensmalltalk/Squeak5.1-16549-32bit.image
